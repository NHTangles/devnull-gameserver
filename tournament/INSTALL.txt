This is version 0.2.0 of the /dev/null/nethack Tournament Game Server
(Just in case you didn't know what you were fiddling with.)

This package includes our own Tournament-specific changes as well as
Jukka Lahtinen's logmove patch, and Mikko Juola's PRNG patch.  The game server
distribution also uses or includes The Dev Team's NetHack, Cyrus Dolph's ZAPM
and Shellinabox by Markus Gutschke.

NOTE: script/makeserver-OpenBSD.sh automates the process for creating a game
server on OpenBSD from scratch; even if you're using another Unix, you may
find it useful to read through the script.
The instructions below are for building on a Debian/Ubuntu style system, but
should be adaptable to any suitable platform.

You may also need to change the following line in include/config.h to reflect
the path to gzip on your particular machine:

	#define COMPRESS "/usr/bin/gzip"          /* FSF gzip compression */

NOTE: All paths here are relative to your NETHACKDIR, which you set when you
compile and install NETHACK.

SECURITY NOTE: By following these instructions, you are effectively giving
root access on your box to the Tournament administrators, since the script
"synch_users.pl" must run as a root cron job and, for us to update the code
during the Tournament, it is owned by "nhadmin".  Please check the code in that
script and in the include files it uses to satisfy yourself that we aren't
doing anything dangerous.  Since the Tournament depends on us having the
ability to log into your box as "nhadmin", it is therefore possible for us to
change this code.  Thank you for trusting us!  ;-)

A NOTE ON UNINSTALL: We recommend that you use a newly installed system for
Tournament Game servers, and that you wipe/reinstall that system when the
Tournament ends.  As an alternative, however, you can (depending on your
Operating System) use a command like the following to remove the player
accounts created by the Tournament system:

	grep nethack.login /etc/passwd | awk -F : '{print $1}' \
	| xargs -n 1 userdel

PREREQUISITES: You MUST have a compatible Unix system with bash, wget, rsync
and LWP (the libwww for Perl) installed before this system will function
properly.  rsync must be installed such that it is available from the PATH of
the nhadmin user (which you will create during the steps below).

As it stands, you need to perform these steps, roughly in this order:

1)	Build and install the devnull release of NetHack 3.6.0:
	git clone http://github.com/NHTangles/NetHack36
	cd NetHack36
	git checkout nh360_devnull
Build according to the included instructions, and install as user and group
"nethack".  This should amount to:
	cd sys/unix
	#edit hints/devnull and change the prefix if you don't like /opt/devnull
	./setup.sh hints/devnull
	cd ../..
	make all
	sudo make install
        # use update instead of install if you already have things you want to
        # keep in the install location.

If you can't choose the install user at build time, you can
create nethack:nethack and the change the permission mannually:

	chown -R nethack:nethack NETHACKDIR
	cd NETHACKDIR
	chmod ug+s nethack
	chmod u+w save
	chmod ug+w logfile record xlogfile

2)	Install ZAPM 0.8.3 (as user "nethack", group "nethack"); The source
for a tournament-patched version of zapm is available on github.

	git clone https://github.com/NHTangles/devnull-zapm
	cd devnull-zapm
edit the ZAPM Makefile with your NETHACKDIR

	GAMEDIR= "NETHACKDIR"
	DATADIR= "NETHACKDIR/zapmdir"

compile and install ZAPM:

	make
	sudo make install

NOTE: *BSD machines will probably need to use "gmake" instead of "make"
in that command

3)	extract the tournament distribution to the NETHACKDIR, generally
with a command like:

	git clone http://github.com/NHTangles/devnull-gameserver
	cd devnull-gameserver
	sudo cp -a tournament NETHACKDIR

4)	create a user called "nhadmin", group "nhadmin"; this user's home
directory must be set to the "tournament" directory in NETHACKDIR (wherever
that ended up on your server, since that directory contains the ".ssh"
directory the control server needs to talk to your new game server and because
all game server paths depend on "nhadmin" having that home directory; this
user should also have a valid shell, [preferably tcsh]. As root:
	adduser --home NETHACKDIR/tournament --no-create-home nhadmin

5)	create a user and group called "nhplayer"; add "nhadmin" to the new
"nhplayer" group.
	addgroup nhplayer
	adduser nhadmin nhplayer


6)	change the ownerships of everything in the "tournament" directory to
"nhadmin:nhadmin" (since its user number matches that account on my box,
but probably not on yours), with a command like:

	cd NETHACKDIR
	chown -R nhadmin:nhadmin tournament

7)	set the permissions on the scripts in the bin/ directory to permit
their execution:

	chmod +x tournament/bin/*.pl
	chmod +x tournament/bin/nethack.*

8)	change the group ownership of the NetHack save directory to "nhplayer"
and make it set GID, generally like this:

	chgrp nhplayer save
	chmod g+s save

9)	change the group ownership of the ZAPM save directory to "nhplayer"
and make it set GID, generally like this:

	chgrp nhplayer zapmdir
	chmod g+s zapmdir

10) change the group ownership of the game playback files directory to
"nhplayer" and make it group writable, and change the permissions for the
"temp" directory, generally as follows:

	cd tournament
	chgrp nhplayer gamefiles
	chmod g+ws gamefiles
	chmod g+ws temp

11) change the group ownership of the Challenge files directory to
"nhplayer" and make it group writable, generally as follows:

	chgrp nhplayer challenge
	chmod g+ws challenge

12)	edit the Tournament configuration file (which is
"tournament/conf/nethack_tournament.conf") to match your system setup and
change the user messages in "tournament/message"

14) add the Tournament login shell to the "/etc/shells" file on your server,
possibly as:

	echo NETHACKDIR/tournament/bin/nethack.login >> /etc/shells

15)	add the Tournament's scheduler to your root crontab, like so:

	#NetHack Tournament Scheduler
	0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,55 * * * * NETHACKDIR/tournament/bin/cron_tasks.pl

16) [NOT TESTED] if you choose to, activate the telnet daemon either by
running telnetd or by activating it in "/etc/inetd.conf" and "kill -HUP"ing inetd;
telnet is no longer required for the Tournament, though, and we've stopped
supporting it on our own servers.

17) [NOT CURRENTLY WORKING] if you choose to, build and install the
Tournament's modified version of
Shell-in-a-Box; this will allow your server to offer tiles

TESTING:
        If desired, create a user for testing.
	adduser --home NETHACKDIR/tournament/players/nhtest --shell NETHACKDIR/tournament/bin/nethack.login --uid 9998 --ingroup nhplayer nhtest

18) sign up for a game server administrator account on or site at
<http://nethack.devnull.net/tournament/registration.shtml>.

If you have any problems, please check "http://nethack.devnull.net" for an
updated version.  If you are using the current version, but still having,
trouble, please send an email to "admin@nethack.devnull.net".  We'll try to fix
it as quickly as possible.
